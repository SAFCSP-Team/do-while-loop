# Do-while Loop

### Objective

In this project, our main goal is to understand how to use a  do-while loop in C++.

### Problem

Develop a program that calculates the sum of numbers entered by the user using a do-while loop, stopping when a negative number is entered.

- Example, the program will output:
```
Enter the number (enter a negative number to stop): 5
Enter the number (enter a negative number to stop): 6
Enter the number (enter a negative number to stop): 7
Enter the number (enter a negative number to stop): 9
Enter the number (enter a negative number to stop): 2
Enter the number (enter a negative number to stop): 0
Enter the number (enter a negative number to stop): -2
The sum is 29
```

### Implementation
- Write your code in the main function.
  
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    /*Add your code here*/
    return 0;
}

```
